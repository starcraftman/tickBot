__User Feedback/Ideas__
- Change ticket creation and swaps to follow timeout, practice never times out.
- Three different reactions, practice, ticket1 and ticket2 flows.
- Each ticket flow has own roles pinged/viewing, own messages set by admin.
- Clicking ticket, immediately makes new in category. Prefix channel accordingly.
- Ping user inside to answer questions. When questions done, open to claims by roles assigned.
- Once claimed, only staff & participants.
- Rather than swap, simply make it unclaimed and back to initial state.
- Pin a control panel inside each ticket with reactions to handle changing state:
  close ticket, unclaim, report issue?
