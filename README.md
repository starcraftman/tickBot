## A Simple Ticket Bot

### Overview

A simple ticket bot was requested so I am making it.

### Requirements

So react to get support, then type out answers to the prompt,
then bot spits out questions with your answer and pings trusted support,
then trusted support only can react to a message / that message to open channel.
Once in the channel, $ticket close reason is probably as good as a react, and
then there are prompts there to type out (or that could be reactions with yes / no but
idt that would make too much of a difference either)
Oh also if it pings the users when the ticket is open, that might be nice too,
because it might be confusing where the ticket is otherwise, cause it doesnâ€™t teleport you
into that channel when it opens so you might not see it
